"2","11/4/2021","Jacqueline P.","Beachwood, OH",4,"This busy busy place is loud and bustling with folks! I wasn't comfortable because barely a mask was on and we were a foot away from strangers in the midst of COVID so I kept my mask on most of the time, but we enjoyed our food.Nothing much is low cal or a healthy option but what BBQ place is going to be!The ribs were fall off the bone tender, the onion rings were big and crispy, the fries were french (LOL) , the shredded pork was piled high with 2 sauces and the meatball parmesan was saucy and cheesy!Overall, a great smoky smelling spot for KSU families!"
"3","3/27/2022","Ashley M.","Cleveland, OH",4,"I've been coming to Ray's place since college. It's always a good time and I always know what to expect.  It's a Kent classic! There's a good mix of college kids and older adults. They ID at the door of course. There's a bunch of tables and booths inside - they easily accommodate bigger groups! There's also a bar inside as well. The bathrooms are also typically clean and well stocked, which is better than a lot of other bars in the area! The biggest thing they're known here for are Long Jsland Iced Teas - it's like their classic. They're $4.50 a glass. I'm a big beer drinker and they have a pretty extensive draft list, with a ton of local breweries, which is really great. If it's your birthday, they they have a fun wheel that you can spin for a free shot :) it's super fun. As for the food, it's pretty good! It's a lot of bar food fare, like sandwiches, burgers. onion rings, fries, etc. I'm never disappointed here, got onion rings the other night and it was pretty solid! My friend had a Reuben and really enjoyed it as well. As for parking, there's street parking available as well as public free lots nearby. I would highly recommend coming to ray's place to meet some friends, I always have a good time!!"

The meatloaf is amazing. Burgers destroy the competition elsewhere. Belgian style fries are as good today as they were over forty years ago.Skip the hype elsewhere in town and give these people your money."
"5","11/26/2021","Alicia S.","OH, OH",5,"I've been eating (and drinking) at Ray's for decades now, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to leave a review. The food here is absolutely excellent. Of course, you're getting bar food (e.g. sandwiches, wings, fried food, etc.), but the quality is better than any around. We've even had our shop's Christmas party here upstairs (pre-pandemic), and they did a bang up job with a large group.This is a Kent staple and a must visit.Pro Tip: Order something that comes off of the smoker (e.g. wings, pastrami, bbq). Yes, they have one and smoke daily. You won't regret it!"
"6","5/4/2022","Dionne M.","Akron, OH",5,"The best burger ever! I was kind of bummed out because Sunday they wouldn't take any carry out orders. They said it was too busy for pick up orders which seemed strange to me, to turn down business because I didn't want to dine in?? Most places will take the order and caution that it's going to be an hour or so before it's busy. But anywho by the next day I had forgiven them and placed a take out order for the mo fo burger and fries. I'm so glad I did because it was GREAT!"
"7","7/21/2021","Laura C.","Shenandoah, Miami, FL",5,"We went for dinner and it was worth the wait time! By the time that we were seated, we knew what we wanted and ordered right away. My son ordered the ribs with fries, my daughter ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries, my husband and I both ordered the blue cheese burger with fries. All of the food was delicious with great flavors! For dessert we ordered the key lime pie and my son and daughter shared it and said that it was good. I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner!"
"8","4/29/2021","Tiffany L.","Hudson, OH",4,"There are a lot of things I like about this place. I like how there is an upstairs and downstairs! It has a rustic aesthetic and I love the drinks. A bit on the pricier side, along with the food. I ordered the stir fry with shrimp which came to about $15. It was super good! And I had leftovers the next day. There were a couple other things I want to try. My only complaint is I wish there were more vegan or seafood options. This place is one of my favorites to go to in Kent. I like going upstairs with a friend!"
"9","4/30/2021","Kristen P.","Canton, OH",5,"I have been going to Rays Place since the 90's when I was a college student. I have watched it evolve from a simple town bar with good food to a fantastic all around restaurant. They have a great selection of alcohol and the menu is a perfect mix of bar type food and great meals. I have to admit my favorite has always been the max the knife sandwich and you can't say no to their fresh cut French fries. Also, it's pretty famous. If you ever find yourself in Kent, Ohio, you must stop in to say hello and have a few pints. Don't forget to pick up a t-shirt, you'd be amazed how wide you can travel the world and have people ask you about it!"
"10","6/19/2022","Brandon M.","Kent, OH",5,"Fast, friendly, and efficient.  Love all their beer and food. Mofo with poutine fries,  OUTSTANDING!!"
"11","7/24/2022","Shelby F.","Columbia Station, OH",5,"I don't know why I haven't gone to Ray's sooner! Love the food and the amazing selection of beers and other drinks. Staff is always friendly! They also offer DORA drinks which is super nice too for when you are waiting to be sat."
"12","9/10/2022","Benjamin B.","Hudson, OH",5,"Great beer selection, good food, but most importantly, best bathrooms in downtown Kent"
"13","9/8/2022","Tonya A.","OH, OH",5,"Good food and good atmosphere!  Good size portions,  clean tables and booths .. love to visit again"
"14","2/13/2022","Riya D.","Akron, OH",3,"I've only been to rays for the drinks which are absolutely amazing! Definitely suggest the Long Island iced tea! But the food was absolutely awful! I got the atomic burger which was super bland. Also the fries were super overdone and I ended the night feeling sick for hours! Definitely will stick to just drinks!"
"15","11/14/2021","Veronica B.","Youngstown, OH",4,"Just a regular ol' bar. Sports on the TV and decent music playing. VERY friendly bartenders. Menu is normal bar food with a twist, they have things like hummus, stir fry, and dumplings. My favorite thing on the menu is the smoked wings. I get them hot every time (and you HAVE to get them smoked) They're a Ray's Place favorite and for sure a go-to of mine. They taste absolutely spectacular and the meat just falls right off the bone Everything else on the menu is average, not much more to say."
"16","10/16/2019","Adam R.","Stow, OH",4,"As a bar, it's 5 stars. Ray's is quintessential Kent. Great classic atmosphere, always good service, open late. If you've never been to Kent, it's a must stop for a drink.I'm at about 3 stars for the food. I've eaten here a lot, because it's where everyone always wants to go, but it's incredibly hit or miss for me. I'm usually more excited to drink here than eat. The good: The smoked pastrami sandwiches are a must try, loads of smoky flavor. The mussels appetizer is top notch, way better than you'd expect from pub food. If you get the pulled pork sandwich, they give you a heaping pile of meat. I got a gourmet burger once and thought it was really tasty. The fried pickles and the sauce that come with them are great. I've also always enjoyed the garlic finger wrap. The bad: I hate wasting food, but I don't think I even finished the meatloaf. It's a savory (gravy) rather than sweet (ketchup/ bbq) meatloaf, and tasted like something out of a TV dinner. Maybe it was just that day, and was made a few days before and just re-heated, but not good that particular time. My wife ordered a burger yesterday. They never asked how she wanted it cooked, and it came out with hockey puck consistency, and taste. People love the wings, but I've had bad luck. They were fatty and rubbery when I tried them. The weird: The fries. Sandwiches don't come with fries, you have to order them separately, which is fine. But a single order is $4.75, and it comes in a basket that serves like 4 people. That's great if you want to share, but if you're just a person that wants some side fries, it's expensive and excessive. If you get a $6 basket, I'd imagine it feeds 10-12 people, I'm joking, sort of. The jerk fries are great and have a good kick. The suns stix (sweet potato) are good when cooked normally, but I've had them either totally burnt or underdone enough times to avoid them."
"17","11/18/2021","Art P.","Bay Village, OH",4,"Classic bar in Kent. Great beer selection. The food is ok. Worth a visit in Kent as a classic place."
"18","9/26/2021","Ann F.","Avon, OH",5,"We planned a very casual class reunion here.  Charlie, the manager, was extremely responsive and helpful. Everyone had a great time, and we loved ""coming home""again!"
"19","2/22/2022","Mary T.","Cleveland, OH",5,"A staple for Kent State Students! Amazing burgers, apps, and drinks for a good price. 1000% recommend."
"20","12/20/2021","J. Edward H.","Erie, PA",5,"My wife and I always go here when in town. We live n Louisiana. Best burgers around in Kent."

"22","8/22/2021","Shooter M.","Youngstown, OH",4,"I'm not a five star reviewer, but this place gets a 4.5 from me. Great food. Exceptional service. Would highly recommend this place to anyone dropping their kids off at KSU!"
"23","12/20/2021","Sarah E.","OH, OH",5,"We absolutely love Ray's. Probably the best burger in town( with the works)  we sometimes change it up but usually we just get their burger and onion rings and their  employees are amazing and great with friendly service....  love it - we enjoy our time there."
"24","5/18/2022","Jessica P.","Akron, OH",5,"The best Long Island you'll ever get is here! Their  food is great as well.  Always will go for a burger or the quesadillas! Highly recommend if you're wanting to drink and eat. The atmosphere and staff are always great and friendly"
"25","6/10/2019","Andrew L.","Austin, TX",4,"Came here on a Sunday evening to catch the game and grab dinner. Fairly sparse crowd as you'd expect for a Sunday night, but plenty of tvs which made it easy to watch. Great variety of beers available at reasonable prices. Their flight deal (4 5oz beers costs however much the most expensive of the 4 as a pint is) is one of the best values I can remember. Nachos were tasty, nice serving size for the price, but nothing to write home about. The stir fry was much better than you would expect from a sports bar! All the veggies were well roasted, the chicken wasn't too dry and the Szechuan sauce went nicely with all of it. Overall, chill place to catch a game with a wider array of food options than the appearance would lead you to believe."
"26","1/12/2021","David R.","Kent, OH",4,"An icon of the Kent scene. Above average bar fare, decent drinks. I wouldn't make a special trip there just for the food, but as I stated earlier it is an icon of the Kent scene and must be experienced.... Oh, the staff is fantastic"
"27","2/25/2021","Jason S.","Milwaukee, WI",4,"Ray's a great go to in the college scene that is downtown Kent. Having visited prior to the pandemic, the experience was just as I remembered from 20 years earlier - great food, great selection of beers, loud lively 'ambience' and just the vibe you'd expect a long standing 'go-to' divey like place to have. The sandwich, wings, and soup were all good to great. The service was pretty good too and the seating options pretty good, depending on your preferences. Good burgers or really good pastrami on rye would be my recommendations for the first timers."
"28","5/9/2020","Cherie H.","Rootstown, OH",3,"Entree: Chicken Parm Sandwich w/friesMy first couple of bites were really good. It was juicy and had a lot of sauce and cheese which I love!! However the next bites after that were a little dry. If the chicken wasn't overcooked it would be delish. It think it just went a little too long. The fries were undercooked and a little cold. Overall: It was ok Return Visit: I am willing to give it another try.

"29","11/16/2021","A.J. H.","Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",5,"My wife and I stopped in for a beer and a quick bite. Our family's been telling us about this place for years. It lived up to the hype. Loved the vibe, beer selection, and the food was amazing. Will definitely be back!"
"30","3/6/2022","Rochelle K.","Warren, OH",2,"I love this place! Have been coming to this bar for years .My son bartended there during his college years! The food was always so good ! Well that has changed. We ate there last night and I didn't recognize anything we ordered except the onion rings. I ordered a Rueben Sandwich. The corn beef was so tuff and the  sauerkraut was tasteless. The pumpernickel bun it came on was awful. Rueben's are supposed to be on grilled rye or marble rye . The bun wasn't even grilled. Another person ordered a club sandwich and the bacon wasn't even cooked completely. The fried pickles came out of a bag I'm sure! You couldn't even tell it was a pickle. My husband has never not finished a hamburger but he got the stuffed burger and couldn't finish it. The nachos we're disgusting . Can't complain about the service everyone was so nice. They did exchange my sandwich for a cheeseburger that was good! Don't know that we will be going back! It's so disappointing. So many good memories at Rays Place! Fix the menu or fix the chef !"
"31","1/8/2018","Lindy F.","Atlanta, GA",4,"""Yeah! That's my mo-fo!"" -- Jerry Maguire (1996)I travel quite a bit for work and rely on Yelp to help me find the right places to eat (Thanks fellow Yelpers). My coworker was no help, so I happened upon Rays. I ready so much about the Jerk fries and the MoFo Burger, we just had to come.This is definitely a ""hang-out"" type of joint. The place was busy, but not too busy. A more relaxed atmosphere, but this isn't a place to come when you are in a hurry. My coworker and I grabbed a seat and ordered a couple of things to start and a couple of drinks. He was happy with the beer selection, so we were all set. Jerk fries are where's its at! This is a MUST. So flavorful, you just can't stop eating them. We also ordered the fried mac n cheese. They were good, but paled in comparison to the fries. I mean, really everything did. I also ordered the MoFo Burger (as instructed by fellow Yelpers) and I wasn't disappointed, but it was a lot. It's a double stack, but more-so than I am used to where I am from. Usually, they are super thin patties. So when I was asked how I wanted it cooked, I knew it was going to be big.The burger came out medium (as instructed) and it was juicy and delicious. Piled high with toppings (mushrooms, ftw) and tough to eat (who has a mouth that big?). I had to squash it down to be able to eat it - and it was pretty messy. I was too full to try the peanut butter pie (fail), but man it looked amazing. I would come back again, for sure.But damn those fries..."
"32","3/10/2021","Jack M.","Stow, OH",5,"Ray's IS the place!beer selection? amazing!food? always delicious!smoked food?must have!I've been going to Rays since 1981and I've loved it every time.try it, you'll like it"
"33","3/5/2022","Billy C.","OH, OH",1,"I was given an extremely hard time by the floor manager of this place. She told me my ID was fake simply because it was an out of state ID. How embarrassing. Next time anyone from the northeast comes here, I hop you invite the entire national guard with you. Otherwise, please do not expect to be able to come into this establishment."
"34","9/23/2018","Emily L.","Columbus, OH",4,"A little bit loud, BUT overall wonderful place! Absolutely delicious, homemade everything!! It's a bar, so makes sense. I got the Mustard Seed 2.0 and a side of French Onion Soup, both we're super filling and absolutely delicious. Classic place to go in Kent and wonderful selection of beers on draft, too! Enjoyed an Oktoberfest. Mussels and Pickle fries as an appetizer, yummy! Super delish seasoning on the food, and the French onion soup was absolutely perfect.Definitely a cute, traditional place to visit while in Kent!"
"35","7/29/2021","Vickilyn J.","MD, MD",5,"Our favorite place for dinner and a beer in Kent! The on-tap list goes on and on. Poutine fries (with house smoked pulled pork), chili, and the veggie pitas are some of our favorites."
"36","3/18/2019","Keri M.","Cincinnati, OH",5,"This is my favorite place to go in NE Ohio, anytime and all the time.  The beer selection is absolutely crazy - I cannot tell you how many they have on tap and bottled - but pretty much any beer you'd like to sample, well they have it, especially NE Ohio beers.  Of course they serve traditionals like Guinness and Bass, one of the only places I know of to get Bass on draft.The food is wonder for a pub venue.  The wings are the best in NE Ohio by far, and among the best I have ever had, big, meaty and deliciously prepared with a choice of many sauces.  The burgers are awesome, and the double burger with cheddar and bacon is a culinary killer.  The chicken quesadilla delicious and quite filling, as are the hot nachos.  We go every week and have - never - had a bad meal at Ray's.  French onion soup, BBQ, salads... everything is prepared fresh and carefully.Ray's atmosphere is also wonderful.  The waitstaff is amazingly attentive considering just how busy it is here... and it is always busy on any day of the week (I've been on every day...).  The Pub is also for everyone - old, young babies, college kids, retired, even people ordering a bottle of wine... in an Irish Pub.  Plus, it is located in downtown Kent.I just love Ray's... it's my go-to for food and beer, and I highly recommend it."
"37","9/20/2018","Chad D.","Tallmadge, OH",4,"Service was 5 stars, Everyone walking by checked on us! Food was good, but we felt some of it was a little bland. However the menu is extensive, we'll be back to try out other things!"
"38","8/28/2018","Rick L.","Youngstown, OH",4,"Loving this place. Lunch. Very friendly staff, great food, and great place! Love the view and the walk to get here. Right downtown, but you can wander around and bump into things, to work up an appetite. Daily specials, beer and food. The menu is killer.  Just pretty darn happy right now, all due to this place.  Thank you Ray's!"
"39","2/14/2020","Robert S.","Aurora, OH",5,"Amazing food and drinks.  Boddingtons on draft. Fantastic menu. Great atmosphere."
"40","7/17/2018","Jim F.","Mount Pleasant, SC",5,"Whenever we visit Kent Ohio we always look forward to eating at Rays...we are never disappointed!all the food is great so its hard to pick but the burger is unreal! Fresh cut homemade fries and of course, the largest selection of cold brews in the area. Highly recommend to all!"
"41","8/15/2021","Marc C.","Westerville, OH",3,"This place was highly recommended by a few coworkers. Everyone said to try the wings. I ordered the smoked wings with the Cilantro-Lime-garlic sauce on the side. I was disappointed as the wings were very dry, inside and out, and the outside was crunchy. These almost appeared & tasted like they were Fried, not smoked. I've eaten plenty of wings, as they are my top 5 fav foods, and these just didn't live up to the hype. With enough sauce I did eat them because they were edible and I don't like to waste. My two other friends enjoyed their food! Would've given a 4 star review but I gave a 3 star because of the service. Our waitress came to our table once to give us waters and then to drop off our food. Never saw her again after that. After sitting for awhile and not seeing her, we finally asked the hostess for the check. Since my friends enjoyed their food, I would give Ray's Place another chance because I do understand every place has an off day."
"42","8/16/2019","Desiree C.","Victorian Village, Columbus, OH",1,"I have NEVER experienced something like this before. My boyfriend and I were in town for my graduation. We walked over to eat dinner from a quick beer at Water Street Bar at 5pm. We had a plastic Kent State souvenir cup (empty) and we sat at the bar. An older bartender yelled at us for having the cup saying they were a direct competitor. We didn't have anywhere to put the cup so he wouldn't serve us. He told us we were advertising another bar as he continued to yell. He made a scene in front of customers. I think he lost more customers yelling at us and making a scene about it rather than the ""cup advertising"". I have never been to Kent State (I'm a distance learner) so I'm not familiar with Kent State. DO NOT support an establishment that treats their customers like this. I do not recommend this place. We never made it to the food because he refused to serve us with the cup. I would give this place negative 20 stars if I could."
"43","8/17/2019","Tehya M.","Kent, OH",4,"This place is one of those restaurants/bars you always come to if you're in Kent. That being said, it's almost always busy here and it gives for room for your order to be wrong/longer wait times. I highly recommend the wings, either smoked and traditional. Our server recommended the cilantro lime garlic sauce and it didn't disappoint!! I usually come here while on a bar crawl but I would come back for the food also"
"44","10/29/2019","Robin S.","Tallmadge, OH",3,"A Kent landmark. Generations of students and townies have eaten here side-by-side.Excellent burgers that are on the large side. Their Mo-Fo Burger has been lauded by celebrity chef Michael Simon as the best burger he's ever had but it is beyond my capabilities.The dining room is not especially comfortable; wooden stools, straight-backed chairs, or hard wooden booths are the seating options. The decor is average dive bar and the music is meh. Lotsa tvs tuned in to sports. A second bar is located upstairs and is a popular spot for private parties. Catering is available there.Servers are attentive without hovering."
"45","8/30/2020","Glenn G.","Garrettsville, OH",5,"Ray's is open again and serving the best burgers in Kent. I challenge you to find better! The meat is slightly charred, has great grilled flavor. Fries and o-rings are awesome, and the chili is top notch. Get there on a Friday when they have clam chowder, it's outstanding. Keep up the good work!"
"46","10/14/2019","Jenna C.","Kapolei, HI",5,"Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. My husband and I came here for lunch and we will not leave disappointed. If in Kent, must stop for a bite."
"47","5/27/2018","John T.","Chicago, IL",3,"Looking for a beer and a burger? Look no further. This place has a great selection on tap. Be sure to try their beer flight to get a good buzz going.Food is flavorful; I'm especially taken with the MoFo burger and the wings. The wings, in particular, were not over-fried nor dry and stringy - rather, they were perfectly juicy, tender, and hot.Overall, the dining/drinking experience was a good one. Service was snappy. Get a bar seat to observe the bartenders punch in sales on an old-time cash register. It's all good fun."

"49","12/13/2020","Tracy H.","Tallmadge, OH",2,"Last Saturday was my fist and last visit. My daughter left her purse there and called the next morning to ask about it. She was told there was no purse. She drove up and asked if she could look upstairs where she had been seated, and was told no, because there were customers. The manager took her name and said he would call her if they located it. She got no phone call. She cancelled her credit cards. The next day after work, her husband went up there and was able to walk upstairs where the purse was exactly where she left it. Terrible way to treat customers. He obviously never looked for it. The only bright spot of the visit was the waiter. He was awesome."
"50","6/11/2021","Glenn F.","Cuyahoga Falls, OH",4,"Good burgers and good beer on a Friday night. Wait staff are friendly and prompt. Always enjoy going to Ray's Place."
"51","6/25/2019","Matt M.","Stow, OH",5,"This one is more for nostalgia than anything. Ray's is and always will be my favorite place in Kent. Nothing fancy and the downstairs lighting will always be a bit too bright, but you gotta love Ray's Place.The staff is always professional and attentive. They aren't always warm and fuzzy, but they are real - and that to me is better than being around someone trying to fake it through the night!The food at Ray's is very good for bar food and the tap lines are always clean, so hangovers aren't as bad...which is important!!I definitely recommend Ray's Place when you visit Kent.  It's an institution."
"52","7/26/2019","Dicky L.","Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA",3,"This place was recommended by a colleague and it was ok. Ray's has a ton of taps and a variety of bottles and cans, so they have options for any beer lover. The staff was attentive and friendly. I had fried pickles which were great. I tried the sandwich special which was mediocre at best. Their menu has plenty to choose from, but I typically go for specials... well because they are usually special. No need to call it out, but it makes you wonder about the rest of the menu. At any rate, the staff and beer selection make this place worth while."
"53","3/10/2019","David C.","Woodstock, IL",4,"Ray's was recommended by a student at Kent State while we were on a college visit. Since we needed lunch and ended up at the fashion building on the downtown edge of the campus anyway we walked to the railroad tracks. it was hard to find. signage is very subtle, the awning was clear but hard to see from the sidewalk. just look for a Irish pub kind of place.the ground level was packed at 4 pm on a Friday. fun kind of Irish pub place, servers racing around. the hostess suggested we go upstairs since it was crowded and we had 5 people. very good suggestion as we were the first to be seated. I got the 4-flight of beers, including an imperial Stout, a gose, and a house IPA. I love the flights.we started with fried pickles, since some of the kids had not had them. excellent. we all had burgers. the student recommended the""mofo"" Burger, but it looked too big. I ended up with the stuffed gourmet, which was about 6 inches tall and excellent. others did the naked burger and dressed it. I had the jerk fries; they were good, but not real jerky, more like seasoned fries. they were good and greasy. we left very full and the upstairs dining room was packed by the time we left. popular place and with good reason."
"54","10/25/2020","Bret W.","Northfield, OH",5,"Among the top wings I've had. Try them plain with the sauces on the side! Crazy selection of draft beers to top it off."
"55","3/7/2017","Chad B.","FL, FL",5,"Ray's is hands down my favorite place in NE Ohio to get a Burger!  When you want good old Bar Food, this is where you go. While the Burgers are the highlight for me, the wings and fries are also huge hits! Especially the Jerk Fries!  The also have a fairly extensive list of Craft Beers on tap and in bottle. Each time I go I find something new.  The first time I was here I found my favorite burger, the MoFo! I got to wash it down with a WTF beer! I love telling that story. Ray's is the only place I know where you can get a MoFo and WTF!It can get crowded in here at peak times but they do have downstairs and upstairs seating. If one looks busy, check the other. It is a perfect place for after work gatherings or parties. They have always accommodated our large work groups if we call a few days ahead.  The staff has been great and always knowledgeable of the menu including drinks.  Since it is located in downtown Kent, parking can be tricky at times but if you luck out, you can find free street parking. Just don't try to park across the street in the Puffer Belly lot. They watch it like hawks!"
"56","2/17/2020","Short Stories By M.","Vancouver, WA",5,"I was in the  mood food Guinness draft and mussels and this place had it.  Good attentive service and reasonable prices."
"57","12/9/2018","Jimmy O.","Elyria, OH",4,"So.....we came here and got seated, party of 5, after about 20 minutes. Once seated we got our drinks in about 10 minutes later. Ordered about 10 minutes after that. That was the last time I saw an employee of Ray's at our table for the next 40 minutes. We watched as other tables, that were seated after us, got their food. I finally got our waiter's attention and asked about our food. I was assured it was on its way out in 5 or 10 minutes. 25 minutes later I got up, found our waiter, and asked him why we still had no food. That's an hour and a half after being seated if you're keeping score. While I was talking to the waiter, the manager came up and asked what the problem was. I told him and he explained that he instructed his staff to tell everyone that the food would take an hour after ordered. Had we been told that, we would have never sat. It was now 9pm. That was the extent of our conversation. The food arrived shortly thereafter. This is where my negative review falls off the rails. It was amazing. Every single item. Amazing. It was legitimately one of my favorite meals. As we were finishing up, the waiter came and apologized and said the manager was comping the entire meal because of the delay. I went back to the manager and told him I didn't want a free meal. I told him the problems we were having were not related to the food. I WANTED to pay for the meal because it was that good. He refused and simply asked that we give them another try when it wasn't so busy (because of KSU move in day presumably) and I agreed to do that. I will update this review once we eat there again. I tipped the waiter 20 bucks and we left. I'm giving three stars because the wait really was atrocious, but the food. Man. So good. We'll be back soon.  I have high hopesUpdate 12-8-18:True to my word we came back. Service was spot on and the food was equally as good as before. I got the wings and they weren't my style, but they were good. I like my wings a little thinner and dryer and these things were monsters. Like I said, good just not for me. The rest of the food was great. Family of 5 for $60. We'll be back. The first time looks like a fluke."
"58","9/7/2018","Donna O.","Columbus, OH",4,"Ray's Place is one of those legendary-to-locals restaurant/bars that many college towns have - lots of sports and local memorabilia on the walls, scuffed floorboards, sassy wait staff and big plates of food washed down with beer. Ray's does it better than most. We walked in on a Saturday evening (the night of the NBA finals!) and made our way around the big bar/dining room to a table. While it was self-seating for us, I doubt it's like that when it's super-busy. Lots of families chowing down on wings and other bar food. Our server was nice, attentive and a whirlwind as the crowd got bigger.The menu is large and varied, with plenty of seafood on the menu, and lots of Greek/Mediterranean influences in the dishes (read Feta and goat cheese, olives, etc.). They must be known for their Fo-Mo burger, which is a double cheeseburger with bacon, mushrooms and all the fixins. Looked good, but we ended up with a Pittsburgh throwback ""Steak-n-Fry"" salad for the spouse and a French onion soup (decent) and a half-smoked chicken for me. The chicken specifically tasted like it had been in the smoker all day - nicely done.Honestly? Traditional non-fancy bar food should be this good always. Stop up at Ray's to try it for yourself."

It's always fun to feel like you chose a happening spot, and this did the trick. It had one of my all time favorite beers on tap, the Willoughby Peanut Butter Coffee Porter. While I love the PBCP, I might be outgrowing it as it was crazy sweet. Anyway, they had tons of other beers on tap. About 20-30 in fact. They also have a huge selection of canned/bottled beers that make for a huge selection. Good prices as well. As for the food, I just had a dozen smoked wings. They were good (but it's kind of hard to mess up wings). I'm curious to try more food off the menu. If end up living here, I'm sure to be a regular at Ray's place."

"73","6/26/2015","Mandy L.","Kent, OH",5,"Ray's has some great food including the best burgers in Kent and what I would argue is the best sandwich I've yet had in Kent - the CUBAN.  I tried the Cuban once on a whim and now I am obsessed. The Cuban consists of smoked pulled pork and ham (double pork!) sandwiched in between two flatbreads with melty cheese (I usually ask for Pepperjack but it comes with Swiss) and crispy wonderful dill pickle slices. It is served with a side of ""Annato Mayo"" which is an unusual sauce that I find intellectually confusing but quite palatable and complimentary to the sandwich in practice. This sandwich is BIG so I'm usually left with at least a second half that gets happily devoured for lunch later in the week. Amazing with their jerk fries which are fantastically spiced! (And a ""single"" order of fries, as opposed to the ""basket"", comes in a smaller basket and is plenty for two to split!) It's often quite busy, and sometimes it's difficult to find a table if the upstairs is closed. You can eat at the bar but waiting around is well worth it as well!  They run a tight ship here and I've found service is consistently good even when they're slammed.In terms of it also being a bar, they have a wonderful selection of drafts and ok cocktails. Long Island Ice teas seem to be perpetually on sale and they are ok too. For some reason, this is the bar everyone decides they want to be at around 1:30am. I've never understood waiting at the door to get into a bar fifteen minutes before last call but I guess it's a thing.  Ray's gets extra kudos for what I've heard second-hand about their great treatment of employees. It seems like they go all out for their people with events like their employee Christmas party and summer camp-out."

Finding a seat was difficult but once I had one I was engaged within 5 minutes and ordered my drink. I sat at the bar as it was only place open and my server/bartender was kind enough to ask if i wanted a single or double. Drink was served quickly and was very well made.Food was served quickly enough as well. Sadly this is where i had a lack luster experience. The Burger was good. Nothing amazing, no stand out flavor but a burger cooked properly. The Poutine option I chose was where the entire experience was really hurt. Their Poutine is serves with fries, pulled brisket?, gravy, mozzarella balls. Now the Mozzarella was the most flavorful thing in the whole thing... Fries tasted unseasoned, and the meat was...... not great more like day old stew beef? That was not the worst part.. All oft hat could have been saved if well the gravy wasn't just terrible. congealed flavorless. I added pepper twice and still did not get any actual flavor... Almost like someone just thickened a sauce leftover? Sadly this kinda ruined my mean as it was largest part of it.All of that for 25$ I would say Probably overpriced. If the Poutine wasnt terrible I would say pricey but worth it. Sadly its left as just overpriced."

If you are from the area, you know all about Ray's. But if you're not, it's a classic themed, two story bar and restaurant that serves typical American food and good beer (as well as a full bar). At night, the upstairs area turns into the typical bar scene. I've never actually hung out downstairs after hours... I think maybe the older crowd hangs out down there?If it's your birthday you get a free shot by spinning a giant wheel and taking the one it lands on.

"81","7/28/2017","Emma B.","Centerville, OH",3,"This restaurant is typically for Kent State alum reliving their glory days and it shows. The service was good, though it was probably due to it being 4:30 in the afternoon during the summer. Portions were big for a fairly inexpensive price per person, so it would probably be a  good place to go with large groups. I ordered a turkey burger and shared one plate of french fries and one plate of their signature sweet potato fries with one other person and we struggled finishing it. The turkey burger was good but nothing to write home about and the french fries were a little undercooked and flavorless. However, their sweet potato fries were phenomenal and if I ever came back I would get those and leave."

Overall I would give it 5 stars, but one waitress did put a bad taste in my mouth.She came to the table to ask what we wanted and after my order in the worst tone and attitude ""are you gonna tab out, because you're not gonna do this over and over, so if you want more keep it open""I would recommend starting with ""would you like to open a tab?""

"87","3/2/2017","Alicia O.","Cleveland, OH",5,"Ray's Place as a restaurant is about three or four stars. There's a lot on the menu, varying in quality, but at least you have the option.Ray's as a bar is the best spot in Kent. The upstairs level is very college-y, with a pool table, full bar, and brightly lit. It's always packed. The main floor/downstairs is cozily lit. The music is never intrusively loud, nor is the sound. Rays is the type of bar you can have a conversation at. If it's not a more mature crowd, then it's a more chill crowd. The people looking to get rowdy usually stop in to spin the birthday wheel and leave or go upstairs. One thing I cannot praise Rays enough for is forcing their bartenders to be educated on how to properly make a drink. Their legendary Long Island's are always consistent in taste. I've never had a drink made so poorly it was undrinkable, which I can't say for other bars in the area. Ray's is an awesome way to kick off, end, or even spend the night at. You'll never run into a sobbing drunk girl or someone passed out in the bathroom. You'll have quality drinks and a relaxed night."

I'd been to Ray's before, but only for the brews, many, many years ago. I must say, the MoFo is gigantic, so much so that I believe it has it's own gravitational pull as mine practically imploded on itself. Easily the messiest burger I've ever had, but it was very, very tasty! Just know that this is a burger in which you might have to repent after eating, as your very soul may need a good scrub."

Rays was actually the first place I ate at when visiting the university for the first time. When I come back as an alumni to recollect on the glory days, I will be sure to visit Rays. Almost any time someone visits me from out of town, I take them to Rays. It's a local staple, and I've found that if someone from out of town has heard of Kent, they most likely have heard of Rays. When I come to the restaurant during the day to eat, I usually get the veggie pita and fries. I'm a vegetarian, and this is one of my favorite places to get a veggie pita. When I come to Rays at night to go to the bar, it's is always busy! Every time I go to the bars in Kent, I end up at Rays at some point during the night. The Long Islands are what the bar is known for, and I usually like to go to the second floor if it's open since it's usually less crowded. Rays will for sure be one place that I will miss when I graduate."

It was on a Friday afternoon, just about ready to hit the dinner rush hour so we were lucky as we only had a 10 min wait or so.   In the mean time the smell of the food cooking and watching everyone guzzle down the beers made everything look very promising.   Clearly when you walk into Rays, there is no doubt this place has been around for some time and it is well used.    Not the cleanest place, BUT, by far not a dump.    The wait staff is energetic, know their way around the menu and provide good tips on what beer to get.   We started off with a few appetizers which one could make a meal of just by this menu alone.   But, we were in good spirits, having a lot of fun and we stuffed ourselves silly and order some main meals as well and boy they did not disappoint us.  Thank you Rays Place for putting the cherry on the top of a great day!"

"110","9/9/2016","Rachel M.","Kent, OH",5,"Ray's is a local staple - let's be real, everyone loves Ray's. Any time alumni visit or family comes in from out of town, Ray's is where they want to go. It's a really cool place, with exposed brick, walls of windows, and two floors - which means two different bars, with different beers on tap depending on where you are. I haven't had anything bad here, but my favorite is definitely the Cuban Sandwich - instead of on a bun, they serve the sandwich on flat bread (which means its huge), and instead of mustard, they serve an annato mayo on the side. And I don't know what's in it, but I wish I did because i would put it on everything. I always ask for extra sauce, and I go through all of it - it's delicious. Ray's is vey well-known for the burgers (and those are good too), but I highly recommend giving the Cuban a try.Ray's drink game is strong, too. Like I said, they have two different bars, which means they have twice as many taps available as most places. And they switch out the options regularly, so there's always something new to try. One thing I'm trying to get into is asking for samples of beers before I make my decision, and Ray's is a great place to start the habit, because there's so much to choose from. If you're not into beer, no worries - they also serve wine, and their cocktails are affordable and well made.Considering how popular Ray's is, it's not uncommon to have a wait, especially if you have a larger party. I've recently noticed that they've started seating guests on the weekends, which is a big culture change. And I'm not sure I like it - Ray's is a bar, and it's set up like a bar. There's no space for a hostess station, and without that, there's no visual cue that you shouldn't seat yourself - so you'll see a lot of confused customers wondering why they can't stay at the table they found for themselves. But it's no reason not to go - just look around as you walk in to see if there's a bartender-turned-hostess running around seating people before you search out a table on your own."

We let them know we were new in town and they told us about the area and gave us suggestions of places to check out. We love the food and atmosphere here each time we've visited."
"115","5/29/2018","Elaine R.","Akron, OH",3,"Staff were very knowledgeable concerning food allergies but menu just didn't have many options for gluten free and dairy free. My vegetarian friend was very happy with her vegetable stir fry. We happen to visit on a day that a large group was having a birthday bar crawl and looked to be having a lot of fun. My grilled chicken salad was good. The portion was more than generous. Great location and memories from years past spent in this city and on the campus."

It literally tasted like charcoals and like it fell into the grill pit and they took it out dusted it off and served it...... I am totally disgusted and will never ever eat here again!!!!"
"117","3/2/2018","Valerie P.","Indianapolis, IN",5,"This place is great! The downstairs seems small, but then there's a whole 2nd level with an additional bar and dining space. They have plenty of vegan/vegetarian options outside of your typical bar food option - black bean burger. They accommodated a group of 20-25 of us and made our experience one I'll definitely repeat. Our server, Chris, was super helpful and we'll request him on our next visit. He paid attention and really helped make this visit go smoothly."
"118","1/31/2016","Olwen C.","Lexington, KY",4,"I liked this bar. It was a fun place to hang out and have a couple drinks with friends without spending a fortune. The food was better than most bar food. Their menu is actually pretty extensive and they have daily specials. Everything was very reasonably priced. I had the atomic burger and Cajun fries.  Burgers are only $5-$6 and we ordered a basket of fries to share for 2 people and it was huge. 2 burgers, fries, and 4 beers came to $42. Not bad!"
"119","11/4/2017","Deepak R.","Hudson, OH",5,"Very nice and a friendly atmosphere.  Stopped in for a quick bite. There was no wait time.  Food and wine selections were great . Service was excellent thanks to Brenton. Would definately recommend this place. ThxDR MD"

"121","9/11/2017","Matt S.","Akron, OH",3,"Decent place in downtown Kent. The I ordered a burger and fries, burger was good, but I'm always confused/dubious when they don't ask how you want it cooked (it appeared to be medium). The fries were okay, but were a but soggy. Overall, nice place, nothing amazing, nothing bad."

The Mo Fo burger lived up to the hype.  The wait staff is super, helpful and eager to help.  The basket of fries were like going to the fair.  The Reuben was enormous but so full of flavor.  The burgers are flame grilled with the edge crust that makes the burger.  They cook their burgers to medium and it was delicious. Must stop in Kent.  Plus, extensive beer menu!  Always a plus."
"124","10/16/2019","Scott B.","Twinsburg, OH",5,"I work in Ravenna, and decided to stop by Ray's for lunch with co-workers and I was very impressed with it. I had the BLT with jerk fries (fries with jerk seasoning) and it was all very tasty. The service was good, the servers were friendly, and the food came out in a timely manner. The place has a nice atmosphere, I will make it a point to check it out after hours sometime so I can sit at the bar and drink."

"126","12/17/2010","Krystal D.","Manassas, VA",3,"Updating my review...but keeping the rating the same.  Here's why.I like Ray's.  Really.  It's my favorite place to go with friends after a long week of graduate school work.  I love the atmosphere and the staff members who work there are great.  And yeah, they still serve Woodchuck.I do have two gripes.  First, they're kind of overpriced for what they serve.  I somehow managed to drop $50 here last time.  And they have a really bad habit of ""forgetting"" to give you the happy hour discounts.  From 4-9pm on most days they offer $1 off all drafts.  Well, when you get your bill later in the night, your discounts aren't reflected.  And your server will probably make a huge fuss if you ask that you bill be fixed.Gripe two: The food really sucks.  On my last review, I said it was passable.  I don't think so anymore.  Last time I went I ordered a grilled cheese and when they brought it out, the cheese wasn't even melted.  So, I sent it back.  When it was returned to me, it was exactly the same as when I sent it back, so they obviously didn't do anything to it.  Also, it tastes like they put salt all over the bread.  Really gross.  I've had similar issues with the quesadillas, the hummus (their hummus is foul), the veggie burger (also foul) and many other things.  The only ""Safe"" menu option is the sun stix (sweet potato fries) and even those are mediocre compared to other places.Go for the drinks and for the company, but do not go for the food."
"127","12/1/2009","Theresa H.","Streetsboro, OH",5,"Micheal Symon from network had this place on Best thing I ever ate. He was right the food is great and so is the service, I had a bacon cheese Philly and it was great.  I will be going back again. Kids can come here too."
"128","8/30/2017","Aaron A.","Cleveland, OH",4,"You can't go wrong with their burgers and wings, some of the best in the county.  But this time I tried the corned beef sandwich on their special pumpernickel roll, if your into a lot of bread this is for you, if not, I recommend something else, the bread to meat ratio is way off."

"130","8/29/2017","Mary S.","White Lake, MI",3,"I went to Ray's on a Sunday afternoon. The first bartender who approached us had a bad attitude but the second one was delightful. I ordered a veggie burger and it was delicious as well as the sweet potato fries. However, NEVER order a margarita. They are disgusting and taste like tequila and salt water. Other than that, it was enjoyable."
"131","8/29/2017","Eric D.","Arlington, VA",5,"Cannot call yourself a true Flash until you go to Rays. Amazing food and some awesome drinks for a great price. I enjoy the MOFO with a long island. Nothing better to get over a exam than a trip to Rays. I did order a Tequila Sunrise and the bartender was upset with my choice which soon became a LI, so you will also learn what a girl drink is lol."
"132","5/13/2015","Brett A.","Kent, OH",4,"Who doesn't like Rays? It is beloved by townies and students alike. Their food is great, their beer selection is great. LOVE that they have Strongbow on tap! They have an upstairs and a downstairs, large bars, a couple pool tables, and an open air area in the summer. If you aren't getting beer, the drinks are a bit pricey for the pour you get and it does get super crowded to the point sometimes you just can't go in. But those are the only downfalls. Overall, 4 stars."
"133","2/4/2017","Steven G.","Orlando, FL",4,"Nice bar. Good food. Bartenders were really nice and knowledgeable. Jake was our bartender and really knew his beer and helped us get a good beer we liked. It's not hard to be nice and these guys know how to do it! Thanks for the good experience."
"134","5/26/2018","Luke L.","Zanesville, OH",1,"I was in town and read some good reviews so thought I'd try it out. Ordered a newer item the poutine. Their version has fries, pork, pork gravy, green onions and sprinkled with lettuce. I was pretty pumped until it showed up. I've had poutine at dozens of places, and I like all the ingredients they had listed but this dish showed up in a disgusting pile and just didn't work together. The wilted lettuce on top just made it worse. I tried to be open minded and tried a couple bites before giving up. When I went to pay my tab the bartender had left it on there, I had already told him i wasn't happy with the dish and returned 95% of it. He simply told me ""yea it's not a traditional poutine"" (DUH!) and never offered to take it off. I'm a generous tipper and not afraid to spend money on  good food, won't be back here though !"
"135","7/13/2017","Lisa T.","Cleveland, OH",2,"Stopped here when at Kent for a college function.  The place was pretty busy so I figured it had to be good.  At the encouragement of the waitress pumping the smoked meat, I decided on pulled pork.  Everything is ala carte so I also ordered cole slaw and rings.Pulled pork was medium warm.  Overly smoked and sauce was bland and salty.  Cole slaw was typical and fresh.  Rings were heavily breaded and greasy. This is the place for late night, drunk dining.  I wouldn't rexommend otherwise on what I ordered.Service was immediate and friendly."

"138","10/6/2015","April H.","Columbus, OH",5,"Couldn't get enough of this place.  During my first visit to Kent, we went here twice in one day, once during the day and the other late at night.  Their Cuban sandwich is memorable.   I usually forget how foods taste after like 2 or 3 days, but its been about 60 days since I've had their food and I remember it.  Their menu describes their version of the Cuban as a sandwich with ""ham, smoked pork, swiss cheese and dill pickles pressed together between grilled flatbread.  Served with a side of Annato mayonnaise."" I was salivating as I was eating the sandwich--it was that good!  That Annato mayo was something else, I'd like to take a bottle of it home and just put it on everything I make.  When we went to Rays later that day for their night life, their kitchen was closed but they still had cold sandwiches. I had the turkey sandwich.  I'm not much of a cold sandwich person, but I was hungry, it tasted good and it did the trick.  They stuffed that sandwich with A LOT of juicy turkey!    Great experience!  I'll be back the next time I'm in Kent."

"140","7/1/2016","Pam C.","Indiana, PA",2,"I've been to Ray's about a half-dozen times  before as I live three hours away from my best friend in Kent. I usually stick to the burgers - I love them - but this time I decided I felt like the hot pastrami on grilled rye sandwich and some fries. The fries were great, as was my friend's Cuban sandwich, but unfortunately the pastrami on my sandwich was so caked in straight black pepper that it was inedible - black pepper was all I could taste, even on the meat that was away from the peppered edges. Couldn't taste the rye bread, the swiss cheese or the whole-grain mustard. I called the waitress over so I could just send the sandwich back and have it removed from my bill, and I'd just finish the fries. Wasn't very impressed when she told me (very kindly - no fault to her) that the sandwich couldn't be removed from the bill and my only options were to have a corned beef sandwich or a sandwich (didn't get the name) that apparently comes with pastrami and cole slaw; the cole slaw would apparently 'calm the pepper down'? Then there was a remark in the direction of telling me all about how pastrami was made - I make it myself at home (and yes I do use pepper) so that was a little condescending and not really necessary. I understand the stuff gets a pepper rub on the outside, and I put plenty on mine but yours is too much. I saw slices of meat with nearly a quarter-inch of pepper on the rim. So to wind it up, I would have been pleased if this had happened differently. There shouldn't be any quibble about taking a sandwich off a check if your customer finds it inedible after three bites! It's *very* bad business to make a customer pay for inedible food, and also bad business to not have a manager to the table to discuss what went wrong. There was some kind of a discount applied to the check by the server which was nice but it wasn't the whole amount of the sandwich. And on another note, my friend and I both were looking for beers and the beer list is so heavy with IPAs there were hardly any other types to choose from. Maybe shake it up a little bit and remember there's a large (very large) segment of the population that find IPAs bitter and weirdly grapefruity. So, two stars for the inedible food with no manager apology, too IPA-heavy beer list, and the policy of not immediately taking inedible food off a customer's check. All my other visits would have been a 4 or 5 star and I'm hoping next time I come back I can give one of those."
"141","9/2/2016","Lauren P.","Myrtle Beach, SC",5,"Great service, warm ambience, and excellent food! This is my go to stop when I go out to eat in Kent. They have award winning burgers and the wings are pretty fabulous too (just order them extra crispy!) They feature specialty drinks each month, and the bartenders have to pass an exam before serving so they know what they are doing. Try their long island (better than any other I've had) or futhermucker if you want something a little sweeter."
"142","3/23/2018","Debbie N.","North Canton, OH",1,"My first time there was last night, March 22, took 43 minutes to get our food, which came out lukewarm except for the onion rings and they were cold.

Great craft beer selection, too. FYI, there is an upstairs, so don't be discouraged if the downstairs is full. Try this if you're in the neighborhood for a show at the Kent Stage, as it is right around the corner."

Their Long Island is the favorite drink for everyone. Their burgers are delicious as well. I have a lot of fun whenever I come here no matter what hour it is (dinner time or going out time). I recommend coming here with a group of friends to hang out and eat some appetizers. The conversations will flow and no one will want to leave!"

"149","3/11/2012","Jaime W.","Houston, TX",3,"Since I was visiting my baby sis in college (Kent), I came here for lunch with them, hearing that there's this MOFO burger that was pretty awesome to try. Even if I'm on this strict diet of mine, I decided to try it anyways since I came from out of town and supposedly it's amazing. Boy, was I right. It felt like I didn't have a burger in ages! Stacked with 2 meat patties and all the works, it was DE-licious. It's definitely a lot to consume for 1 person so I split it up with my sister. The bottom bun got soggy after having it stacked with lots of ingredients on top but I didn't care much about it anyways since I was starving. Along with our burgers, we also ordered their sweet potatoe fries which was good as well but we ordered way too much food for just 4 of us. We were stuffed! As far as the place goes, it's a casual. So nothing fancy at all. It is a bar at night but during the daytime, they serve breakfast and lunch. The bathrooms were a bit out-dated and kinda gross. But what can you expect from a bar that was probably filled with college students the night before?"

Yes, THE Jack Lambert of KSU and Pittsburgh Steelers fame. Side Note: He had all his teeth then.)Beers on tap so numerous they change eight each month as new beers. Known as one of the first bars in the US to televise football games.Great sandwiches with many burger choices. Opens at 11 through 2:30 am with a special ""late night"" menu after 11 pm. Noisy late at night with students. Pleasant until then with distincltly different lunch and dinner crowds.The phone booth doesn't work any more but that is the only change in all these years. Known by parents of all KSU grads with no bad references.

Based on the reviews fried mac&cheese, jerk fries, and a burger is the way to go. I got all of those which I got the Atomic Burger, sounds better than it was. By no means was the FOOD BAD, it just wasn't anything special. First with the mac&cheese bites they were good. If you have ever gotten mac&cheese bites at Sheetz, these are the same exact ones and probably more expensive. I would not say this is a must have item. The atomic burger wasn't anything special. The patty seemed like it might have been out of a box. The party was bland. The toppings was nothing special just some pepper jack cheese and some Jalapeños out of a jar. I would try something else than a burger if I came back here. The jerk fries were good. The portion is large enough for two people to eat them. If you are into the jerk dust I would recommend them. They were also fresh cut so that is a plus. The bar overall has a very cool vibe I would go there to drink at night. Their cash register is old school and give a cool touch. Lots of beer options too!"

Fresh beef, cooked to perfection, fresh toppings. A pretty good crowd on a Friday at 10ish did not prevent our server from doing a nice job with a pleasant attitude.The area is pretty cool, with several eateries and bars. Especially in the summer us older folks can relive the feel of a college town without having to wade through drunken frat boys.I would encourage those looking for hummus and vegetarian to seek other options. This place is good for tavern food."

So I guess you could say that I've been saving this review since that fateful day in 1978. I was a 17 year old high school student visiting Ohio from California to see my brother. Since we're of the same Father, it was perfectly natural to find a bar, have some cocktails, and renew that brother - brother relationship. Bob suggested Ray's Place and off we went.[2]Being so young, dumb, and full of ...what's that rhyme?...booze, I don't really recall much of Ray's Place, but it's obviously a place where magical relationships can be made, so I'd say check it out if you're looking for love (or cocktails).[3]Footnotes:[1]  A term my brother used ad nauseam until we broke him of it.[2]  We didn't let trivial details such as my age interfere.  [3]  I magically met a gal, as well, but only for that night."
"181","9/8/2013","Maria B.","Millbury, MA",3,"Great beer selection, so-so burgers.I was underwhelmed by the Mo'Fo burger, which I ordered on the recommendation of many other yelpers. It was certainly large enough, but the meat was flavorless, and I felt generally pretty sick for the rest of the day. If you're looking for a burger made with flavorful, local, high quality beef, take your business to B-Spot or the Rail."
"182","11/19/2009","Nick D.","Austin, TX",4,"I am going to do two reviews of this place, as it changes dramatically depending on when you go.Review 1:  For dinner, Ray's is very solid.  I have yet to find a bar that rivals the beer selection anywhere else.  The portions are VERY generous (strongly recommend the pasta with sausage and peppers), and the overall atmosphere is very pleasant.Review 2: This is one of the worst places you could go on the weekend for nightlife.  All the frat boys who aren't still passed out from the previous evening's Bud Light, Cornhole, and Date Rape Extravaganza all flock here to get into fights about Browns v. Steelers and brag about how much they've manscaped in the past week.  Also, the bar TVs will constantly be playing some kind of sport; they will be playing GOLF before Comedy Central is on there.  In addition, the staff is so overrun with orders that you won't get served for a long while.Overall, I do like this place a lot; I just hate seeing it devolve into what it is on Friday/Saturday evenings."
"183","8/10/2016","Stef E.","Kent, OH",5,"I'm a fan and have been for years! Always great service and great food! When people come visit me in Kent, they always choose Ray's! The steak salad or Ruben are my go-to's. Keep up the great work!"
"184","3/5/2016","Aaron S.","Stow, OH",5,"This place has surprisingly amazing food for being a great bar. Usually you get one or the other. It gets packed when there's a game on and when the late night crowd comes in, but service is always good and attentive. If you can, try the Mofo burger! It's awesome in every sense of the word. It's one of those burgers that once you pick it up, you can't put it down. Too messy to risk it, but it's also that good. Peppers in oil, jerk fries, and nachos are also worth getting."
"185","1/8/2010","Damian C.","Chicago, IL",2,"1 - Why are french fries not included with your sandwiches?  A sub-par wrap with fries should not cost $10.  This is Kent, Ohio, not a major city!2 - Why did the doorgirl study my ID (Illinois) like she was studying for the GMAT when I was walking in with my dad?"
"186","1/5/2009","Pablo E.","Akron, OH",4,"Ray's Place was the first place I ever visited in Kent.  For a Bar in Kent, it's really nice inside and the food is good, the beer list is excellent.  For a restaurant, the service is slow and the place is just too damn loud... so if you're looking for a place to go out with people where you'll have plenty of time to talk but where you can't hear anything, Ray's is the place.The food is good and it is generous.  The sandwiches are delicious, particularly the cheeseburgers.  The reuben is also a favorite.  I've never gone wrong with the daily soup specials either.  The beer list is pretty diverse and deep, with probably more than a dozen on draught, though I think a nice budget option (PBR anyone?) would be a good addition.In my experiences, Ray's has different clientele at different parts of the day.  Lunch seems to be mostly Kent business people and such, dinner seems to be more the university faculty, and at around 11 pm it shifts markedly toward annoying preppy college brats.  While it's loud during dinner, it gets really loud when drunk frat boys yell at each other during the later hours.Ray's is the best bar-restaurant in Kent, by far (though not the best bar) in terms of things you ingest, but beware the changing atmosphere and the noise."
"187","2/8/2007","Krissy M.","San Francisco, CA",2,"Do you love frat boys wearing their letters and yelling about which chick they have/have not, would/ would not do?  Nope, I'm not a fan.  I don't care too much for that frat boys at a bar scene.Rays was the one place that you knew you would end up at because, honestly, that's all there was at Kent back in 01.  It was also the one place that you didn't want to go because you would see the same scene on repeat.  Frat, Frat, Frat and the girls that love them."
"188","2/22/2016","Heather A.","Kirtland, OH",5,"Visited Ray's Place when visiting some friends in the Kent area - and although we are definitely over the average college-town age, it was a good option!  Food was relatively inexpensive and the menu had great choices - Definitely recommend the goat cheese and marinara app.  Cute restaurant for a college town!"
"189","4/2/2008","Eve D.","Kent, OH",4,"Ray's is a comfortable and friendly place to hang out. The early crowd is less frat-like and more sophisticated so if that's your group you'd better be there before 11pm. The food is good and has remained relatively stable throughout the years. Broccoli Cheddar balls and the hamburger your way are faves and the wings are phenomenal. With the Ohio smoking ban Ray's has transformed, no longer do you leave with the need to shower and wash your clothes - and the food tastes oh so much better without the smoke! There was a remodel last summer and Ray's now sports windows along the front lower bar area that allow in lots of light and great views of the Pufferbelly, Gazebo, and the road.Overall, Ray's Place is a classic college town bar with different on-tap selections in the first and second-floor bars as well as any mixed drink you can think of and plenty of wines by the glass."
"190","12/10/2011","Nicole W.","Columbus, OH",3,"Lets be real -- we can't beat the beer selection @ Rays. I love the changing taps and specials and appreciate being able to get any type of beer I'm in the mood for.Now to the food -- I honestly hate most of the menu, but I will give them some props for the newly added tacos which I have enjoyed.Its a classic hang out, so I go with friends - but I really enjoy long periods without Rays."
"191","5/10/2015","Gulsheen K.","Kent, OH",4,"Finally had some real fries which were not preserved for 8 months before being deep fried! Great food and service."
"192","9/16/2010","Sam R.","Cleveland, OH",4,"I'd vote 3 1/2 if I could, because the whole ""it's a different restaurant depending on when you go"" thing is absolutely true. I wouldn't step foot in this place on a weekend.The service is generally good, though sometimes you do get your fair share of apathetic-part-time-college-waiters-who-are-totally-apathetic because its a bar in a college town. Good, not great.Portions are generous, and for such a huge menu for a bar, its surprisingly consistant. Which while on the whole is a bit above average (3 1/2 again) I think they deserve some respect for being able to put out burgers and lobster ravioli of equal quality. Also, get the jerk fries, they're amazing.Oh, and heres the thing that made me give 4 as opposed to 3 stars. The Friday Clam Chowder. I've been all across the eastern seaboard and nothing there compares to the thick, creamy, generous serving of their incredibly herby chowder. It may seem a tad pricey for the bowl, but it fills you up reeeeal nice."
"193","6/3/2016","Kristen B.","Cleveland, OH",5,"I'm a huge fan.  Professional and attentive staff, delicious food, affordable prices.I've never had fries so fresh!  Just come here for the fries....nom nom nom!"
"194","12/1/2010","matthew m.","Kent, OH",3,"As other reviews have noted, time of day is the deciding factor in your Ray's experience. Before 10pm, it's the first place I'd recommend in downtown Kent. After ten, the last place I'd recommend. The ""late crowd"" packs the place, to where there is nowhere to stand comfortably; forget about getting a single seat. Food-wise, it's a step above standard bar fare, both in variety and execution. I've had a number of meals that were far better than they should have been, and the fries are the among the best in town. The selection of beers is staggering, The service is always competent, but nothing to rave about.It's a fantastic choice for an early date, but a terrible choice for a nightcap."
"195","12/21/2015","Becky B.","Cuyahoga Falls, OH",5,"Great atmosphere, food, and beer choices.  Get the sweet potato fries and the peanut butter pie....trust me."
"196","5/19/2018","Lindsey T.","North Canton, OH",5,"The long island from Ray's Place is the most important element of my college career.  Would absolutely recommend.  The staff is pretty friendly and the food (from what I've had) is pretty good!"
"197","7/5/2010","Kevin D.","Stow, OH",5,"Great food, nice selection of beers and excellent service. It's by far one of my favorite bars in Ohio!"
"198","6/2/2015","Maggie F.","Akron, OH",4,"The food is unmemorable but tasty and effective. I like drinking at rays place with friends on weekends because the music machine is cool and the bar seems chill and unassuming. What I mean by that is I feel more comfortable hanging there than the water street tavern or zephyr. Oh, and the pool tables upstairs are fun. :)"
"199","5/8/2013","Antoni G.","West Chester Township, OH",3,"My brother in law lives close by and went to Kent so he had to take me to Ray's Place.The bar was packed and we were a two family group of 10 so we went to the upstairs and it was basically ours. The service was fast and friendly. She was pretty knowledgeable about the menu and recommended the Michael Simon favorite burger. The burger was very good and worth getting if you are finding trouble picking off the menu. The level of homemade aspect of the patties seemed to be in question, but I will give them the benefit of doubt. We also grabbed the sweet potato fries and a basket or two of the jerk fries. The macaroni and cheese bites were not to my liking but they were a hit with the kids.They had multiple beer specials and a very good selection to choose."
"200","3/30/2013","Jim W.","Yellow Springs, OH",5,"Students were on break, but still crowded. Great space, lively, with just enough tv's to follow game, but not enough to dominate conversation and turn it into just another sports bar.In particular, the bartenders were friendly and knowledgable.  Plenty of fine microbrews on tap.  Noise level wasn't so high so as to discourage conversation. Even the Tina salad sandwich wasn't half bad."
"201","2/9/2016","Chris F.","Tallmadge, OH",4,"Love Rays. Discovered five years ago and love it. Perfect college bar restaurant feel. Good selection of drafts, flights are fun. Nice menu selection have never gotten bad good here. Peppers in oil is great local appetizer; basic appetizer but some ice surprises. Excellent burgers, corned beef has an addicting smoky flavor. Downsides- wait for a table; college town organization; loud( guilt that comes with sitting too long as hungry people look over your shoulder. Rays is pretty much Kent."
"202","4/25/2016","mark t.","Kent, OH",4,"This is the place to been seen and not heard in Kent.  Great selection of beer.  This place can get crowded so be prepared to wait.  Any time friends come in from out of town, we usually end up at Rays."

Didn't end up eating the burger; instead took it home to my daughter who loves them.  Service was good, interiors haven't changed since I went to college at KSU (many years ago).Great Pub."

"207","9/2/2017","Dianna G.","Blacklick, OH",3,"Ray's has always been a favorite place to eat in Kent. I ordered my usual Cuban and Long Island iced tea and was disappointed to find that instead of the usual thick slice of ham, Rays had changed to a chip chopped ham and the pita was dry and crumbly. My party also ordered the Ruben and it was on a pumpernickel bun instead of grilled bread- a big disappointment! The jerk fries and Long Island iced tea were delicious as always and the service was excellent. Needless to say, we will look for another restaurant the next time we're in Kent."
"208","12/5/2014","Marissa M.","Richmond, VA",3,"I stopped by here while on a road trip with my brother. He saw this place on a food show, so I was like ""Hell yes lets go!!""  We slip the mofo burger and it was really good, tasted like a typical greasy spoon burger but like 3 times the size. It was not bad, it was just not special. More does not make it taste better. Fries were good and greasy and the beer selection was as nice. I don't know how it go recognition to be on a TV show, either way I am glad we tried it."
"209","5/12/2014","Drew H.","Medina, OH",5,"Love Ray's place.  It was one of the first places I was told I needed to check out when I started working in Kent. It did not disappoint. Hands down the best beer selection in Kent. They have a great selection of craft beers and they consistently add new ones on draft. I've only eaten there a couple of times but the food was great as well. The service is great. Even when the place is packed the staff makes sure you have everything you need. If you're in town you have to check it out."
"210","11/20/2015","K H.","Kent, OH",5,"I love the burgers at Rays, but tonight I tried their flat iron steak served with caramelized onions and balsamic reduction. It was delicious."
"211","10/29/2015","Jason K.","Willoughby, OH",5,"Best beer selection in Kent by far! And it's always rotating, so there's always something new to try. And the food is above average for a bar. I never have to wait long for service and the staff is incredibly friendly."

"215","3/16/2015","Jarrod R.","Akron, OH",4,"I stopped in here after some drinks at Dominiks do the road on a Friday night around 9:45pm. They sat us quickly, the kitchen closes at 10pm. We quickly ordered, I ordered the mo-fo burger, my friend ordered the bacon cheese burger and we split a basket of fries. The mo-fo burger was amazing but a bite hard to eat since it was so big. The bun fell apart a little but it did not slow me down, I just made a mess of myself lol. The fries on the other hand were just so-so. They were un-seasoned and with no salt. Needless to say I was not impressed with them and would order a different side to compliment the burger next time. My friend enjoyed her burger as well the bacon was delicious. The atmosphere as the typical bar.  I would recommend this place for a great burger. I look forward to trying so of the other food."
"216","3/11/2014","Kirk M.","Fredonia, NY",4,"Dropped by this little tavern on my son's visit to KSU. Had the special of the day a smoked BBQ chicken.  The portion was enormous!  The taste was superb. I loved the dark woody look to the dining area.

"218","4/25/2015","Evan L.","Ravenna, OH",5,"Rays is the classic college town restaurant and bar. The food is great and the atmosphere is laid back. It makes an effort to be respectable and not be one of those dumpy ""let's get drunk"" places to go out in Kent.  If I had to recommend only one place to eat in Kent it'd be Rays.  It's unique and everyone will feel comfortable there."
"219","9/12/2014","Rhett E.","Houston, TX",4,"My wife and I were in town and had Rays recommended. I had the Ray's Reuben and she had the Chicken Gyro. Both were excellent. I rate places on how good their Reuben is and Ray's was one of the better Reuben's I've had in the last 10 years. I'd definitely like to try some other options since my introduction to Ray's was great."

Sat upstairs....had a great server who hooked us up with some great beer suggestions (their list is insane), and some perfect meal suggestions. My peeps all had burgers which they said were great and I had the Cuban. Loved it. Great service, good bar atmosphere (a little dive-y, not pretentious), and good bar food. I think this is one of those places that you shouldn't get crazy with what you order. Stick with tavern fare, and you win."
"222","1/25/2014","David K.","Kent, OH",3,"I have been to Rays place countless times.  It is great for hanging out with friends, they have an excellent beer selection, and I think that their service is usually quite efficient given the demands.  I just wish that their food was better.  The menu always seems a bit ambitious, but the sandwiches can be tough, the burgers almost always overdone, and the french fries too greasy.  Also, their drinks always seem a bit watered down.So, go for the ambience and the history -- but I always try to eat elsewhere."
"223","8/15/2014","Margaret O.","Hudson, OH",4,"Great beer taps. Great atmosphere. Jerk rubbed chicken wings to die for. Calamari. ...a must order. After these aps and Firkin Friday beer....we are ready for the weekend!  Great job, Ray's!"
"224","4/13/2014","Daniel G.","Toledo, OH",2,"I was not a fan of rays, and the purple I went with were not either. The staff was ok, not very attentive but not outright mean. The drinks were very average. However, it was our friends birthday and they wouldn't let him into the bar because he didn't have a second form of ID (he was from PA). Who does that? It doesn't make sense that people should not be allowed in just because they were from a different state and didn't have another ID form. After that, we Obviously all left immediately since we weren't just gonna let him be outside alone. Very disappointing."
"225","8/7/2014","Dominic C.","Kent, OH",5,"If it's your first time in Kent you have to come to Ray's place. A huge beer selection and great long islands. The food is also amazing.

The place was filled up when I got there and also when I left. I had the Wiskey Peppercorn sauce steak with steamed vegetables and salad, it was very tasty.  Service was fantastic, I never had to ask for a refill."
"227","3/2/2019","Kathy A.","Tallmadge, OH",2,"There's Rays upstairs and Rays - the original downstairs.  Have had over 30 years of good experiences downstairs - but upstairs a whole different ball game. Apparently as I was told by the manager Pat , ""Next time you decide to go out on a Friday night with a group of ten you might want to reconsider planning better. "". This was said after we balked at only getting $ 40 bucks off our ridiculously late food order. Ok wait- 5 of us got our meal in a somewhat timely manner. The next 4 of us got ours after the first 5 were done eating. Then our tenth guest who happened to be the birthday guest of honor got his food when all 9 of us were done eating. Yes true story. Because I told Pat when asked how our food tasted- and I replied it was good- that was his sole basis for giving the $40 bucks off. When I said well what about the fact that you have totally ruined the ambiance of our birthday gathering thus is what I was told-  never go into the restaurant management business because obviously you will not be able to handle it.... say what????? Are you kidding me?  No he was not. I never asked for a free meal. I asked for a total of $60 off rather than the $40 of a $200 bill. The waitress even said "" the one time I take the ( food) order the way the tell me to and they screw it up. "" she was referring to taking our orders in two phases which seemed bizarre to us but we did it. The explanation we were given for the whole screw up was a pneumatic tube - clogged tube issue due to the orders being sent down from the top floor. Ok -  so I have to say-  so, so deeply disappointed in the experience and the manager Pat. Shame on you."

The tables are jammed so close you can smell the person at the table next to you, and the noise was deafening.All of our food was either cold or burnt to a crisp, and took an hour to get to us after ordering. My ribs were so burnt (blackened meat and bone slathered in bbq sauce) they were inedible, and half the fries they were served on were still frozen. The fiancee's meatloaf was cold and mediocre at best, and her deep fried mushrooms were overcooked on the outside and under cooked on the inside.They also charged my fiancee 11$ for an Alabama Slammer that didn't seem to have any alcohol in it."

On Sat 1/28/17 we stopped for lunch.  After we finished our meals the server took away the small plates we had not used.  We did have a couple dirty napkins placed on top of them.  I saw the server take the plates to the cart by the window to the kitchen.  He threw the napkins in the garbage then looked at the plates.  He put the bottom plate with the clean dishes.  He inspected the top plated after removing the dirty napkins then decided to put that it with the dirty dishes.  He almost put it with the clean ones.  Hopefully management will coach the newer employees on how to handle dishes from the tables.  Please wash them...."

We wear with one person under the age of twenty one and we wear turned away from eating dinner. I asked the door person if she could just let are waiter know we wear just coming in for dinner. Sharply she said No, and I then proceeded to ask for a manager and she said that was what she was told no one under the age of twenty one allowed. I then said really you are going to turn down are business, she replied with a smile yes we are. Sad you can't hire waiters with the mental capacity to ask for ids."
"236","7/21/2013","Carol J.","Washington, DC",3,"Food is really mediocre and the service can vary from excellent to awful. I came in on a Tuesday night to an understaffed restaurant. It took over 40 minutes for half my party to be served their burgers and the other half of the group, including myself, happened to never get our food, so we left after an hour of waiting. The manager said that this Tuesday happened to be busier than normal, but if the staff could not manage handling the large crowd, then the number of tables for food service should have been limited. I would rather wait for a table and get good service than sit at a table for over an hour being ignored by the overworked servers who can barely manage to handle the number of people they are serving."
"237","3/12/2016","Colette W.","Kent, OH",1,"Awful. This place has been hyped up so much, and I cannot understand why. Every experience I've had here has been disappointing. The employees are rude, including the current manager. The worst time that comes to mind was when my boyfriend and I sat there for nearly 20 minutes at the bar just waiting for our check. Since no one bothered to acknowledge our existence, my boyfriend suggested leaving. I still put money down, but even then no one said anything. Drunken girls climbing over the bar... Stupid loud guys everywhere. Always super packed to the point you can hardly move. Food selection is limited and pretty much sucks. Would love to understand what's so great about this place."
"238","4/1/2015","Ran D.","Stow, OH",3,"Good burger, but service always been kind of a miss for me. Usually have to wait a while to get seated (plenty of seats available just no service) and when sat down have to wait a while to get menu and drink ordered, etc. It's not that their servers are not friendly or do not provide service, but every time I go there I feel like the place has no waiter, and you are just sitting there, table empty, for a while before you are approached. Sandwiches, burgers, and wings are good. But their ribs suck. Fries are decent and onion rings can be meh. If you go there with a bunch of people you will get services a lot quicker. It's just that their waiters are so busy and always running around that they tend to forget about the quieter tables. Still I go there for the good burgers and juicy wings. Wish they had more professional restaurant service though."
"239","5/30/2016","Fred T.","Cuyahoga Falls, OH",5,"We love this place for its fries, burgers, and chef salad. Also has a great drink menu. Best bloody marys around and the servers are really friendly and make us feel welcome. (Jocko is our favorite. )"

"241","6/6/2016","Steve J.","Kent, OH",5,"I've been coming to Rays for over 30 years and it has continually improved and upgraded its offerings. The staff has always been attentive and hustles to accommodate their customers. It can be extremely busy so avoid peak times or you may have to wait a bit for a table and food. The beer selection is great - diverse and always changing. If you're looking for health food such as a kale salad, this isn't the place. That being said, the food is delicious and filling - think mofo burger and meatloaf sandwich.  The specials tend to be lighter and the salads have gotten healthier so Rays isn't afraid to evolve."
"242","2/28/2016","Martin H.","Stow, OH",5,"I love Ray's place it is a great place to eat, it is a great place to go have a drink late at night. The burgers and beer selection are amazing. When in Kent this is the place you have to go to."
"243","1/2/2015","Milan P.","Youngstown, OH",1,"I just returned to my Youngstown home after a trip to Ray's, and my ears are still steaming.In my 50+ years, I've never been treated as rudely, dismissively or flat-out scornfully by anyone representing ""management.""I've endured a lot of grievances over the years to make regular pilgrimages to Ray's:  the hour-long drive; terrible parking; an ear-splitting noise level; a no-reservation policy. But I've remained a loyal patron for a good many years because I love the food:  the pastrami sandwich, the fries, the bacon cheeseburger and most especially the ribs. Everyone who knows me will tell you that I've raved about them in no uncertain terms, even going so far as to describe them as the best ribs I've ever eaten in a restaurant. (Coincidentally, quite a few of said acquaintances have made the trek to Ray's just to try them, solely because of my ringing endorsement.) In all my years of devoted patronage, there were only two occasions prior to today that I complained to a server.Once because my (full order) of ribs had arrived stone-cold.The other because the kitchen had apparently forgotten my request to serve the ribs and fries on separate plates (or basket in the case of the fries). Both times the corrections were made promptly, apologetically and with a smile.Until today.When I remarked to the server that the first two ribs of my half-rack were tough, stringy and dry, she offered to speak with a manager.A man arrived who didn't bother identifying himself, but who clearly seemed to be suffering from anger management issues.He insisted--in no uncertain terms--that the ribs were perfectly fine, and that there was nothing wrong with them. In other words, ""You're an idiot; don't bother me."" (I thought I was watching a ""before"" section on an episode of ""Restaurant Impossible."")When I tried to explain the issue I had with the sampled portion of meat, he blew me off, vanishing back to wherever he came from.Since the fries remained untouched--all I'd eaten was the cole slaw and two (out of six) ribs, the server asked if I wanted to take them with me. A carry-out container was quickly provided.But when the bill arrived, I was puzzled to see that the uneaten (and now absent) ribs were still on the bill. I told the server that, since I was paying for them, I might as well take the remaining portion home with me. At that point, I optimistically hoped that the remainder of the (half) rack would be up to Ray's usual high standards.She once again offered to speak with a manager.Shortly thereafter, the inconsolably rude gentlemen from earlier returned, this time even more obstinate and nasty than he was previously.He accused me of being a chronic complainer who ""always sends food back"" (?), and asked repeatedly why I bother coming to Ray's at all since I clearly ""don't like the food.""I'd say that my attempts to explain the situation--and my long-time enthusiasm for his restaurant and the food--fell on deaf ears, but that would be an exaggeration.  He clearly wasn't listening to anything I had to say and walked off in an insolent huff.The (corrected) bill was resubmitted, but nothing could take the vile taste of my two brief encounter(s) with the extraordinarily hostile manager out of my mouth.I left feeling as if I'd lost a friend. And in a sense I had, since I knew it would surely be a cold day in hell before I walked through the doors of Ray's again.I'll definitely miss the food I grew to love, and the generally top-notch service.But I'll never forget--how could I? how could anyone?--the disrespectful-bordering-on-contemptuous way I was treated.What a horrible way to start the new year."
"244","4/9/2011","Jen M.","Gates Mills, OH",2,"Went on a Saturday night.  Once we were seated we waited 45 minutes for our food.  The only thing that was good on the table was the BBQ sauce--good combination of spicy and sweet.  The french fries were limp and the burger looked like a 9-year old cooked it.  My chili was definitely NOT homemade--it was definitely ""bought in"" from a restaurant supply place.  I realize Ray's is an institution in Kent but the food needs some serious resuscitation.  Taco Tantos down the street looks to be a better food option."
"245","10/20/2012","Lolitta P.","Kent, OH",2,"Nachos were a joke, I had to pay extra for each dip, the only good one was the cheese. The salsa came warm in temperature and tasted more like spaghetti sauce. The fries looked like a big soggy mess. I did think that the mac n cheese bites were ok though."
"246","7/7/2016","Nick H.","Akron, OH",5,"Good food, awesome beer menu. The atmosphere is just okay but the beer makes up for it."
"247","11/8/2015","Edward E.","Columbus, OH",4,"We now live in Columbus and took a trip to see Kent State's wonderful matinee production of Side Show.  Of course we had to stop by Rays Place as we have not been there for a couple of years- IT IS STILL GREAT.  I had my burger which is better than any I have tasted in Columbus and my wife had the Mustard Seed sandwich which I believe is new and is excellent.  Ray's Place- we miss you- the food, the atmosphere and the friendly service.  Kent State students and locals- you are lucky to have this institution; certainly Ohio State in my opinion does not have anything close to Ray's."
"248","7/10/2015","Jeff P.","Cuyahoga Falls, OH",5,"Great place and will always come back but our waitress  needs a personality adjustment."
"249","5/8/2013","Michelle W.","Los Angeles, CA",2,"Overrated. The burgers are decent, but nothing special. They have a famous ""mofo"" burger that is okay, it just has everything under the sun piled on it. Overpriced for sure, I paid $17 for a mofo, (the doesn't even come with fries) a fish sandwich, a side of fries and WATER. They're going to have to lower their prices and up their quality to stay in business with all the new ones coming in."
"250","11/16/2013","Amy W.","Ocean Isle Beach, NC",4,"Ate here for lunch. Grecian salad huge, fresh, and yummy. Tomato bisque soup was creamy and rich. Loved it. Enjoyed the character of the old building. Wait staff was average."
"251","10/12/2012","Eryion H.","Kent, OH",3,"I've been going to Ray's for over 15 years & this place has really gone down hill. I still love their hand made french fries & Bailey's Irish creme pie( if you can actually find a clean table to eat at). But the food & staff's attitude has become less & less inviting. And the bathrooms are always dirty :( Can't say I visit as often or even brag about it's unique atmosphere (can't go wrong with restoring the buildings historical environment) but it doesn't feel like home anymore. Sorry...."
"252","4/28/2016","Jessica S.","Streetsboro, OH",5,"Food is great late night and the bartenders ROCK!! We will be back for sure in the future!! It's a spot we like to hang out with our friends in the front corner window!!"
"253","3/6/2013","Michael C.","Lakewood, OH",2,"Burger was the only decent thing on the menu, and it was cooked way past well done when I ordered med-rare, both times.   Lots of gross frozen fried foods on the menu.Decent beer selection, but what bar doesn't have that now-a-days?Douche-apocalypse at night.Would only go back to drink or if friends wanted to go."
"254","1/20/2015","Dylan B.","Avon, OH",4,"It's a classic Kent spot that always is a bast on the weekend nights. It's a little overrated when it comes to their food, but it is good quality and priced well."
"255","1/13/2010","Scott L.","Bridgeport, CT",5,"Best brew spot at Kent State.Amazing brews on tap and in the bottle.  If you can't find your brew here, you're drinking swill.The food makes great beers taste even better.  Every time I get anywhere near Cleveland, I get my ass to Ray's."
"256","7/16/2015","Jessica C.","Lebanon, OH",5,"This place was FANTASTIC. We went as a big group one evening and hung out at the bar - which has a wonderful selection of craft beer - one night until we decided to get a table upstairs. That night, I had the pulled pork (incredible) and my fiancé had the chicken parmesan (delicious). Between the atmosphere and the staff, we liked it so much that we went back the next day for lunch! We took more family then and they loved it too. If you try anything, get the jerk fries, pulled pork, and a cold draft beer!"
"257","3/9/2012","Cory P.","Kent, OH",4,"There place is great, plain and simple. Their food is amazing and the drink selection is wonderful. Ray's is a restaurant by day, bar at all times. There are two floors each sporting it's own bar. The only issue is the difference with whats on tap from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor. Because they also have a $10 minimum, if you are sitting upstairs but want to beer downstairs you have to order $10+ on one trip or start a tab for that floor, which you probably have a tab for the 2nd floor, which then you would need two licenses...see the issue here? Granted, that wouldn't be an issue for most people at all, just the ones that are ""beer snobs"" maybe? If you want to avoid the overly loud music but enjoy a good dinner come no later then 8:30pm, though 6pm would be better. This place is a bit pricey but what you get is a great atmosphere, nice people, and a great selection of food and drink. I am always down to visiting Ray's Place.Note: I marked noise level very loud because after 10pm they crank up the volume to a level which makes conversation a lot harder. As a friend put it the other day: ""It is lip reading with small fragments of understandable conversation that allows the other person really to get what the other person is saying."""
"258","12/9/2013","Tom L.","Kent, OH",5,"I am a long time customer at Rays Place and I thought it was time to post a review. Is Rays perfect? No. Sometimes the food isn't as good as it is at other times, but when they hit it dead on, it's great. I will say that of all the places I've gone to eat over the years, Rays probably gets it right 95% of the time. Most other places I've been to do not have that consistent of a track record. Honestly, if you are in Kent and looking for a great place to get a meal and a good craft beer on draft, you cannot do better than Ray's. The Hot Pastrami sandwich is excellent, the Italian Roasted Pork sandwich with sun-dried tomato sauce is one of the best pork sandwiches I've had, the Cuban Sandwich is great, and they serve a good regular old burger (which you can dress up to insane levels if you want). They do still source the beef for the burgers from a local supplier (yes, I did confirm this with one of the managers) and I know that the brisket used for the corned beef/pastrami comes for somewhere in Northeast Ohio as well.Yes, Rays is loud and busy around lunch and in the evenings, but that's part of its allure. Rays is somewhere you can go to lose yourself in the crowd. It also hosts a different demographic after 9 or 10 pm Wednesday through Saturday because of the college students. I guess that's one of the side effects of going to a bar in a college town. The great thing about Rays is that you will see people all across the age and occupation spectrum and I always thought the whole point of a bar was to serve as a social gathering place for people in the community to drink beer, eat food, and have a good time. If you happen to be in the Kent area, I would strongly recommend giving Rays a try. At least stop in for a beer, anyway."
"259","1/3/2012","Tiffany H.","London, United Kingdom",4,"Ray's Place is one of my favorite places to get food and beer.  The menu has a wide variety of food, and they always have a huge list of drinks.  The bar tenders can be a little unfriendly at times."
"260","7/29/2015","Monica G.","Ravenna, OH",4,"Food is pretty good minus the mashed potatoes.  Service is decent.  Atmosphere is busy but fine.  Love the location."
"261","11/1/2011","Ron G.","Kent, OH",4,"Rays Place may have seen on TV, Best Thing I Ever Ate.The food is Good nothing spectacular it is average bar food. The bar on the other hand is really fun great people lots of room and the bar service is pretty solid. the food menu is big with nothing that stands out. The best thing in my opinion on the menu would probably be there burger selections."
"262","7/3/2013","Jonathan J.","Kent, OH",3,"Definitely a good place to go. The upstairs bar is better than the downstairs one. If you sit at the bar downstairs, people are most likely going to keep bumping into you. Food is good, but the staff will just look at you weird when you sit down sometimes. Overall, one of my favorite bars in Kent."
"263","1/3/2007","Thomas Awesome G.","Cleveland, OH",3,"This is probably sacrilege, but I think Ray's is just okay. The food is adequate, especially if you just want some typical pub-style beast. There are a few cool menu items (the fried macaroni and cheese, in particular), and there are a number of above average beers on tap. Unfortunately, I've never been a big fan of the atmosphere, the waitstaff isn't particularly friendly, and until recently, you'd smoke a pack and a half just sitting there for an hour. Maybe with Ohio's new smoking ban in place it's a better hangout. Unfortunately, Ray's has just never done anything for me."
"264","2/23/2015","Shawn S.","Canton, OH",2,"First time to Ray's Place and I won't go back...not because the burger's weren't good but the service was lacking.  The waiter took 8 minutes just to make contact and another 12 minutes to get our drink order-not bring it, take it.  I asked if the breaded mushrooms were breaded on site and was told yes (no, they're not).  He never came back to refill our drinks and never asked how the food was...didn't even ask about the uneaten mushrooms that were cooked so hard I couldn't break through the breading...but when I asked another person there about it, he said ""Sorry, we hire the handicapped"".  No, they didn't offer to take the nasty things off my bill and how dare they imply that only handicapped people make mistakes. Being thoroughly disgusted we paid the bill and left and I assured him I would try my best to stop anyone from going there.  Obviously they don't care about customers not satisfied."
"265","5/30/2013","Kalif V.","Kent, OH",4,"Beer specials often (a tall Miller Lite is sometimes less than $3).  Beer tastes really good (I think I read that they meticulously clean their beer lines).  Their burgers are pretty good (I recommend the MoFo).  Sweet fries are delicious.  Mac and Cheese bites?  Yes, please!  Overall good bar food at reasonable prices."
"266","2/8/2013","Scott W.","Kent, OH",4,"If you've ever been to Kent, you probably already know Ray's. The place is an institution. Great beer list, Friendly Staff, decent bar food with wide selection, always loud, always busy. Home.. what more can I say. oh yeah, best burgers in town! The Reuben also is top notch, always."
"267","5/10/2015","Jaymes H.","Athol, MA",5,"Great food and excellent service. It was a bit loud but that was to be expected. Can't wait to go back."
"268","2/16/2012","Gregory P.","North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",3,"Decent bar food.Honestly, it's a better place to go get drunk and have an inexpensive burger than a place to dine-in with your mom and dad when they come into town. I've never had anything off of their menu that's been bad, so that's a plus.Edit: I have to amend this review to add that the rueben was absolutely horrid. No dressing and the meat was so dry I have to think that they kept it uncovered in the refrigerator."
"269","7/19/2012","Nathan B.","Cleveland, OH",5,"This is probably one of the best places to eat in any of the surrounding areas. Their menu is huge, and the food is delicious. They have 40 (or more) beers on tap. Everything is priced fairly, and the service is always great!!"
"270","7/2/2013","Brian H.","Kent, OH",5,"Firstly, this is my go to lunch place if I have friends come from out of town. The jerk fries are amazing, especially with a little ranch. I've always ordered the burgers and they are quite good. Great selection of beer to go with the meal.Secondly, this is a great bar to go to whether you enjoy mixed drinks or beer. Their long islands seem to be the big pick most nights.Only downside I see to Rays is that the area by the bar gets pretty jammed on big nights, but that's a given for a good bar in a college town."
"271","4/5/2014","Max N.","Worthington, Columbus, OH",3,"Through loud noises, disorganised servers, and oddly placed TVs, Ray's place still maintains a three-star rating in my books. Upon walking into the place, something just screamed mediocre at best. No indication whether or not you should seat yourself or you should we should wait, just like most we were confused. After making eye contact with a waitress chatting with a peer, we found our way to a booth on our own. Soon after, we were greeted by a friendly girl, giving us our menus and taking our drink orders. The usual process followed, we ordered drinks, then food. The speed at which the food was prepared was surprisingly fast and tasted great. We finished our food which was quickly taken from our table. I got the cheeseburger - cooked medium well - and it tasted great. However the problem was leaving, as if our waitress did her best to avoid us, we waited 10-15 minutes to get our check. Thankfully once she was finished chatting among other activities she took our card and we got out. Overall, my experience was not the best however I've been to worst places."
"272","12/23/2012","Kyle G.","Kent, OH",5,"I may be biased due to the fact that I know at least 70% of the staff that works at Ray's, but I am appalled that people suggest that the food is garbage and the service mimics just that.  Based on my experience, this remains my favorite place to go out and eat awesome food and drink fantastic beers.  No other bar holds a candle to the quality at Ray's in the Kent area.  I see some reviews commenting on the atmosphere of The Zephyr and 157.  Really?  157?  If you're not a moron, take yourself to Ray's, if only for the drinks alone.  On multiple separate occasions my girlfriend and I have gone to Ray's and walked out loving it a bit more after each meal.  The only critique I have of the place, and this is simply due to my limited preferences of food, I would be wary of the specials at times.  I am much more of a burger and wings kind of person in the first place, so explore your options and find out for yourself.  By no means are the specials bad--they just do not seem to satisfy me in the ways that their burgers do.If you're taking my advice and want to try Ray's out, I suggest the Atomic Burger or the Chicken Parm. sandwich.  Easily the best two items on the menu.  If you have had a few drinks, though, go for the nachos; they are a revelation."
"273","3/16/2012","Christine M.","Stow, OH",4,"I really like Ray's place for an after work beer or cocktail.  They make a really good long island iced tea and their nachos are very good for a group of friends to share. My husband loves the MOFO As far as the evening, it is your typical bar scene on a college campus.  i will not downgrade my rating due to the people that are there late in the evening (typically after 10pm).  It is not the fault of the establishment on how people behave.  As a matter of fact, I give any employee of a college bar props for dealing with ""those people"" that cant help themselves."
"274","3/25/2012","Chris D.","Toledo, OH",4,"My parents hung out there in the 60's when they were students at KSU.  They always called it Rocky's.  I live in Toledo, but I have a daughter at KSU and we occasionally have lunch there on return trips for her.  We very much enjoy the food.  I love the fish sandwich and the kids like the burgers.  Good service and friendly staff. This is almost always on a Sunday afternoon when we are there."
"275","4/24/2012","Carl S.","Kent, OH",5,"Best burger in Kent going away. Famous for chili, though I'm not a chili person. Interesting atmosphere:Mid-afternoon basic bar. Dinner. Almost a family restaurant. After 10. A student hangout. It all works."
"276","11/9/2012","Michael B.","St Charles, IL",2,"great service but the food was okay we had the mo-fo burger just too much meat not  much flavor just because you add bacon and mushroom it doesn't make it great like some rating give it. There was it nothing great about it, pulled pork was dry  I just don't know how they can be in business with food like this. There were a lot of people at lunch time why? I wouldn't go back there, we were visiting from out of town on a visit Kent State."
"277","12/3/2012","Timothy S.","Mantua, OH",5,"These folks know how to hook you up with some decent food. The burgers get most of the attention and honestly, that's where you should start on the menu if it's your first time.Gets crowded during lunch but what do you expect, people like it.EXCELLENT beer menu and really friendly service if you have questions about pairings."
"278","3/6/2010","Andrea M.","Columbus, OH",5,"This establishment has a great menu selection.  Not to mention you receive more then your moneys worth in quality and quantity.  I love this place.  It might actually be my Kent favorite for a bar that serves food.  I have never had a bad experience."
"279","1/12/2014","Jordan F.","Wayne, OH",5,"Went for lunch an had great service from walking in the door, had a double bacon cheese burger am the jerk fries which were amazing.

"280","4/2/2014","Bayern M.","Albany, NY",4,"Love the atmosphere, great beer list, and good pub food. I got the MoFo burger, which was really tasty, however, when I got it the bottom bun was so soaked from the juices that it fell apart and I had no choice but to eat it with a knife and fork, which sort of killed the experience. Would like some better insulation against that in the future. Still, a place I'd definitely return to."
"281","3/22/2014","T. M.","North Kingsville, OH",5,"Ray's has awesome burgers, delicious fries, an incredible beer selection, and a lesser known winner in their peanut butter pie. Atmosphere tops it off to perfection. I've enjoyed consistently awesome food from Ray's for the last 16 years. Still flawless."
"282","12/7/2013","Libby G.","Kent, OH",3,"This is a really fun place with good food and good beer, but even though I've been there many times I have never had good service. The servers make mistakes and they're way too informal. Sometimes uncomfortably so. I like the food, but Ray's is never my first choice for dinner out on Kent."
"283","6/2/2014","Rich L.","Akron, OH",3,"Good atmosphere and great draft selection.  Typical bar food.  Lots of Tvs with games on.  I like the upstairs better where pool tables are located, but usually can't find 2 seats up there, probably because others like it better too."
"284","1/19/2014","Sean N.","Fort Campbell, TN",4,"Was visiting kent on the account my current girlfriend goes to kent. She decided to take me here as she knows I like these kind of places. I ordered a Guinness, the guy pored it the correct way I also ordered the pulled pork and she ordered the meatloaf sandwich. All came out good and overall I enjoyed my time there."
"285","8/28/2010","Elisa W.","Seattle, WA",1,"I guess I was under the impression that this place was actually a restaurant and not just a bar, but when I showed up last night for dinner, the place was overcrowded and completely unorganized.  The doorman was there taking IDs like a bar, but we were there for food.  There was no hostess and as far as I could tell, no waitresses either.  Cocktail servers, yes, but no one serving food.  I don't know when they serve food, and I assume they do since they have a menu, but apparently it's not always an option just to go have dinner here.  When it's not clear as as to when you can and cannot sit down and have dinner and the staff is disorganized, I'm not likely to come back."
"286","8/3/2010","Elizabeth W.","Cleveland, OH",5,"I just absolutely love this place. It's in an old authentic building that is classic downtown Kent. I used to love coming here late nights when I was a college student, but now that I am older, I come here sometimes for dinner and a beer just because the atmosphere is very lively and it is fun. The food is good and it is REALLY cheap. Love love love this place."
"287","7/16/2013","Alex B.","Kent, OH",4,"I am a bit of a regular here. The food is usually pretty good and priced well. The only complaint I have is the toasted subs, the bottom piece of bread is usually soaked when it comes to my plate so I just don't order any thing like that anymore and I have a good time. The beer selection is great! The service is usually decent. The crowd is usually a good mix of people, young, old, hipster, regular joes, you got it all. One of my favorite spots to drink."
"288","7/10/2015","Patrick A.","Stow, OH",4,"food was terrific, although teamwork was apparent, our server needed to be much more personable, her personality was very cold, never even looked us in the eyes."
"289","12/8/2012","Jenna S.","Garrettsville, OH",4,"My boyfriend and I stopped in one evening as we were passing through. The place was packed so we sat at the bar. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. One of the best french onion soups that I've ever had! Great deal on Wednesdays, all you can eat spaghetti for $2.99 WITH salad and garlic bread. I'm severely picky about spaghetti sauce and Ray's was very good! Huge selection of beer! Servers are great! We will be back for sure!"
"290","6/15/2008","Jason K.","Kent, OH",3,"This is the Cheer's bar of Kent.  If you want to run into KSU Alumni or even Drew Carey when he is in town stop here.   They still have the shot wheel for those that are turning 21.  Last year they fixed downstairs with many HDTV's, windows that open to make a more open air bar and a generally more pub feel.  Before 10 pm this is a good restaurant.  I suggest the burgers or the mac and cheese bites.  The food is good for a bar.  After 10 pm is when the Geeks show up, mostly upstairs with Alumni downstairs."
"291","2/22/2007","Doron K.","Kent, OH",5,"Ray's Place is Kent. The best bar in Kent, always the place to finish your night. Also, decent snack food at bar time. Haven't had a sit down meal there, though."
"292","11/24/2011","David E.","Stow, OH",3,"I like this place. I really do. I love the beer selection. I like the casual, comfy ambience. The food is good, when hot. The prices are reasonable.  YET... they OFFER few freaking options with their wing sauces!!! For the record, the Crazy Hot sauce is anything but Crazy or Hot!!! It's a nice sauce, but it ranks on the short side of basic hot. I don't want to cry or sweat when I eat wings, but a little bite, even a lot of bite, is often nice. Crazy Hot? I think not. In general, the wings are very good, but the sauces are a joke. They need to ramp up the variety of sauces. And if they're going to call one of them Crazy Hot, it needs to be at least a little crazy, and at least a little hot."
